# HSL color test

Reading this great article: The HSB Color System: A Practitioner's Primer by Erik D. Kennedy [ https://learnui.design/blog/the-hsb-color-system-practicioners-primer.html ] inspired me to create a visual guide with controls that allow the user to change these parameters and learn what those changes do.

In short, somewhere to have some hands-on practice on this great and not so much used color system.

It has three sections:

The first section is a guide to the color wheel, from 0ยบ to 350ยบ. A quick reference to each color and it angle degree in the color wheel, so to learn about the first value: "H"

In the second section the user can learn how the hue selected with a slider changes within the other tree values: "S" saturation, "L" lightness and "A" alpha.

The third part, my favourite, lets the user create a custom color palette of five colors, modifying every parameter with sliders.

I hope you find this useful!
